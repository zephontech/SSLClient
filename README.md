this is an exmple of making an ssl connection to a server tht requires client certificate validation.

this test requires a jdk. I tested it with 1.8 and 21 and it seems to work.

the certificates were created using my own Certificate Authority. Plenty of intructions on the net. make it a VM so you can 
generate certs when you need them :)
